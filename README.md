## How to Install
XBackBone require PHP >= `7.1`, the composer package manager and writable storage path:

 [https://github.com/SergiX44/XBackBone/releases/latest](https://github.com/SergiX44/XBackBone/releases/latest)

```sh

```
+ Run a composer from your shell:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```

By default, XBackBone will use Sqlite as DB engine, and a `storage` dir in the current directory. You can leave these settings unchanged for a simple personal installation.
You must set the `base_url`, or remove it for get dynamically the url from request (not raccomanded).

```php
return [
	'base_url' => 'https://myaswesomedomain.com', // no trailing slash
	'storage_dir' => 'storage',
	'db' => [
		'connection' => 'sqlite',
		'dsn' => 'resources/database/xbackbone.db',
		'username' => null, // username and password not needed for sqlite
		'password' => null,
	]
];
```
+ Finally, run the migrate script to setup the database

```sh
php bin/migrate --install
```
+ Now just login with `admin/admin`, **be sure to change these credentials after your first login**.

## ShareX Configuration
Once you are logged in, just go in your profile settings and download the ShareX config file for your account.

## Notes
If you do not use Apache, or the Apache `.htaccess` is not enabled, set your web server so that the `static/` folder is the only one accessible from the outside, otherwise even private uploads and logs will be accessible!
The NGINX configuration should be something like this:
```
# nginx configuration

location /app {
  return 403;
}

location /bin {
  return 403;
}

location /bootstrap {
  return 403;
}

location /resources {
  return 403;
}

location /storage {
  return 403;
}

location /vendor {
  return 403;
}

location /logs {
  return 403;
}

autoindex off;

location / {
  if (!-e $request_filename){
    rewrite ^(.*)$ /index.php break;
  }
}
```
