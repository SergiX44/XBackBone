By default, XBackBone will use Sqlite3 as DB engine, and a `storage` dir in the main directory. You can leave these settings unchanged for a simple personal installation.
You must set the `base_url`, or remove it for get dynamically the url from request (not recommended).

```php
return [
	'base_url' => 'https://example.com', // no trailing slash
	'storage_dir' => 'storage',
	'db' => [
		'connection' => 'sqlite',
		'dsn' => 'resources/database/xbackbone.db',
		'username' => null, // username and password not needed for sqlite
		'password' => null,
	]
];

*Clear the browser cache once you have applied.*

### Change app install name

```php
return array(
    'app_name' => 'This line will overwrite "XBackBone"',
    ...
);
```
## ShareX Configuration
Once you are logged in, just go in your profile settings and download the ShareX config file for your account.

## Linux Support
Since ShareX does not support Linux, XBackBone can generate a script that allows you to share an item from any tool:
+ Login into your account
+ Navigate to your profile and download the Linux script for your account.
+ Place the script where you want (ex. in your user home: `/home/<username>`).
+ Add execution permissions (`chmod +x xbackbone_uploader_XXX.sh`)
+ Run the script for the first time to create the desktop entry: `./xbackbone_uploader_XXX.sh -desktop-entry`.

Now, to upload a media, just use the right click on the file > "Open with ..." > search XBackBone Uploader (XXX) in the app list.
You can use this feature in combination with tools like [Flameshot](https://github.com/lupoDharkael/flameshot), just use the "Open with ..." button once you have done the screenshot.

The script requires `xclip`, `curl`, and `notify-send`.

*Note: XXX is the username of your XBackBone account.*

## Web server configuration notes
If you do not use Apache, or the Apache `.htaccess` is not enabled, set your web server so that the `static/` folder is the only one accessible from the outside, otherwise even private uploads and logs will be accessible!

You can find an example configuration `nginx.conf` in the project repository.

## Maintenance Mode
Maintenance mode is automatically enabled during an upgrade using the upgrade manager. You can activate it manually by adding in the configuration file this:

```php
return array(
    ...
    'maintenance' => true,
);
```
